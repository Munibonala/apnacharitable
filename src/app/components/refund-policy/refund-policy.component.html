                    User information on this site is kept strictly confidential. The site may, however, use this
                    information from time to time for purposes such as corresponding with the users for various issues.
                    We shall duly seek permission of the users in such cases.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We collect personal information when you create an account or edit your account information, or make
                    a donation. Some of this information is a legal requirement of the Income tax Department for tax
                    exemption (Government of India), such as your postal address. Other information is used to
                    facilitate your use of the site such as knowing your taxpayer status so that we show you options
                    that you are eligible to make as well as amounts in your local currency.

                </p>
                <p>
                    We do not collect or have access to the credit card numbers or bank account information our
                    third-party vendors (Paytm) collect to process online transactions.
                    Apnacharitabletrust will not share, rent or sell your personal information to third parties.
                    By default, you will also receive monthly newsletters as well as other Apnacharitabletrust emailers
                    from time to time. In case you would not like to receive these newsletters and emailers, you can
                    send a mail to apnacharitabletrust2015@gmail.com with the word 'Unsubscribe' in the subject line,

                    the emailer received.

                    What Are Cookies?
                    Cookies are files or pieces of information that may be stored on your computer (or other internet
                    enabled devices, such as a Smartphone or tablet) when you visit our site. A cookie will usually
                    contain the name of the website from which the cookie has come from, the "lifetime" of the cookie
                    (i.e. how long it will remain on your device), and a value, which is usually a randomly generated
                    unique number/email id.
                    What do we use cookies for?
                    We use cookies to make the site easier to use and to better tailor the experience to your interests
                    and needs. Cookies may also be used to help speed up your future activities and experience on our
                    site. We also use cookies to compile anonymous, aggregated statistics that allow us to understand
                    how people use our site and to help us improve their structure and content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Disabling Cookies</b>
                    You can prevent the setting of cookies by adjusting the settings on your browser (see your browser
                    Help for how to do this). Be aware that disabling cookies will affect the functionality of this and
                    many other websites that you visit. Disabling cookies will usually result in also disabling certain
                    functionality and features of this site. Therefore it is recommended that you do not disable
                    cookies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Third Party Cookies</b>
                    In some special cases we also use cookies provided by trusted third parties. The following section
                    details which third party cookies you might encounter through this site.
                    This site uses Google Analytics which are the most widespread and trusted analytics solution on the
                    web for helping us to understand how you use the site and ways that we can improve your experience.
                    These cookies may track things such as how long you spend on the site and the pages that you visit
                    so we can continue to produce engaging content.
                    For more information on Google Analytics cookies, see the official Google Analytics page.
                    Hopefully that has clarified things for you and as was previously mentioned if there is something
                    that you aren't sure whether you need or not it's usually safer to leave cookies enabled in case it
                    does interact with one of the features you use on our site. However if you are still looking for
                    more information then you can contact us through one of our preferred contact methods.
